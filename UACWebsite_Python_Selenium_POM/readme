The purpose of this repo is to learn and practice constructing Page Object Model tests. 
I choose the Utah Avalanche Center's website as the subject. 
It has many pages that are updated on a daily basis, including text, images, and videos. 
There is a report submission function, a search function, and online sales functionality. 
My goal is to build an automated test suite that remains relavant despite the frequency and number of updates.
